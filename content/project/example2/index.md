title: Code-free Federated Learning User Interface for Industrial level object detection task
summary: Invited by Guangdong Power Grid Co., LTD., we examined a federal learning system for object detection tasks called FedVision, and built corresponding user interface to facilitate the use of the system by some staff in power grid companies who are not computer professional background. The GUI is divided into four main modules, which are dataset configuration module, model parameter configuration module, online visualization of training results module, and model evaluation and release module.
