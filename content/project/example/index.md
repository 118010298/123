title: SQL database and query system for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of US Nation's Bridge, 1940 to 2019
summary: In this project, we build an SQL database and query system for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridge, an original digital record sheet available on the website of the U.S. Department of Transportation. As a general table, the sheet recorded 116 attributes of all Bridges and similar structures in each state from 1940 to 2019 with more than 720000 entries. Classic data mining techniques were then applied to determine how major attributes affect the total annual net expenditure required to repair brideges.
