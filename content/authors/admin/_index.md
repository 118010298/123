Hi! I'm Zhihui Chen; thanks for visiting my homepage. I'm an undergraduate student in statistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I used to work at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/) for 13 months as a research assistant. Now I am currently doing research on few-shot learning and monocular depth estimation under the supervision of Professor Chenye Wu and Professor Rui Huang.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Few-shot Learning, and Robotics and I keep exploring new interesting research topics in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.

I am also the winner of Harmonia College scholarship in two consecutive years, vice president of TEDxCUHK(SZ), and co-founder of Oceania Studio at CUHK(SZ).
